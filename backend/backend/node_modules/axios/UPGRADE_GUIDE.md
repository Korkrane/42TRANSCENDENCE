# Upgrade Guide

### 0.18.x -> 0.19.0

#### HTTPS Proxies

Routing through an https proxy now requires setting the `protocol` attribute of the proxy configuration to `https`

### 0.15.x -> 0.16.0

#### `Promise` Type Declarations

The `Promise` type declarations have been removed from the axios typings in favor of the built-in type declarations. If you use axios in a TypeScript project that targets `ES5`, please make sure to include the `es2015.promise` lib. Please see [this post](https://blog.mariusschulz.com/2016/11/25/typescript-2-0-built-in-type-declarations) for details.

### 0.13.x -> 0.14.0

#### TypeScript Definitions

The axios TypeScript definitions have been updated to match the axios API and use the ES2015 module syntax.

Please use the following `import` statement to import axios in TypeScript:

```typescript

  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(error => console.log(error));
```

#### `agent` Config Option

The `agent` config option has been replaced with two new options: `httpAgent` and `httpsAgent`. Please use them instead.

```js
{

}
```

#### `progress` Config Option

The `progress` config option has been replaced with the `onUploadProgress` and `onDownloadProgress` options.

```js
{
  // Define a handler for upload progress events
  onUploadProgress: function (progressEvent) {
    // ...
  },

  // Define a handler for download progress events
  onDownloadProgress: function (progressEvent) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

### 0.12.x -> 0.13.0

The `0.13.0` release contains several changes to custom adapters and error handling.

#### Error Handling
